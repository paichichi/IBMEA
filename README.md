## Env

Run the following command to create the required conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml -n IBMEA
```

## Datasets

### Cross-KG datasets

The original cross-KG datasets (FB15K-DB15K/YAGO15K) comes from [MMKB](https://github.com/mniepert/mmkb), in which the image embeddings are extracted from the pre-trained VGG16. We use the image embeddings provided by [MMKB](https://github.com/mniepert/mmkb#visual-data-for-fb15k-yago15k-and-dbpedia15k). Place `mmkb-datasets` directory  in the `data` directory.

### Bilingual datasets

The multi-modal version of DBP15K dataset comes from the [EVA](https://github.com/cambridgeltl/eva) repository, and the folder `pkls` of DBP15K image features should be downloaded according to the guidance of EVA repository, and the downloaded folder `pkls` is placed in the `data` directory of this repository.

## How to run script
